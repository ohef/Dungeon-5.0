# Dungeon

This is a unreal engine project/module dedicated to flexing what can be done in
the unreal engine using paradigms popularized in web dev technologies. the goal
is to make an SRPG that has action prompts for dealing damage; the closest examples
being Valkyrie Profile Covenant of the Plume(damn this was an NDS game!) or
Paper Mario. 

The architecture follows the examples in
[lager](https://github.com/arximboldi/lager) with a focus on the simplistic side
of the library (so no futures or any usage externally of the boost stuff).

# Status:

Currently the repo is a bit mismanaged on where code is getting placed; I'm
refactoring a bunch of stuff to modularize and fix the imports, any suggestions
on structure are welcome :)
