# Dungeon

This is a unreal engine project/module dedicated to flexing what can be done in
the unreal engine using paradigms popularized in web dev technologies. the goal
is to make an SRPG that has action prompts for dealing damage; the closest examples
being Valkyrie Profile Covenant of the Plume(damn this was an NDS game!) or
Paper Mario. 

The architecture follows the examples in
[lager](https://github.com/arximboldi/lager) with a focus on the simplistic side
of the library (so no futures or any usage externally of the boost stuff).

# Status:

Currently the repo is a bit mismanaged on where code is getting placed; I'm
refactoring a bunch of stuff to modularize and fix the imports, any suggestions
on structure are welcome :)

# Building

Don't try to build or run it yet...if you're trying to do it you're probably
someone that can contact me easily IRL lol...and if not raise an issue and i'll
probably see it.

You should be able to use it as a standalone game module; but there's a lot of
setup one has to go through to get it working; honestly just don't do it, there
are references that are hardcoded against assets and whatnot.
